## <a name="intro"></a> Introduction

Goldmund.sh is a distributed, multi-service web application designed as an exercise in declarative automation. The entire system automates tests, builds, and production deployments via a single webhook. Conceptualizing, architecting, and building this app has necessitated extensive research and trials; coming up with this stuff has been immensely rewarding, heuristic, and fun. As a developer apiring to be a software architect, I'm rather pleased with the result. I hope you enjoy as well; please don't hesitate to [contact me](https://goldmund.sh/communications) if you did!

### <a name="packages"></a> Packages

 - [`goldmund-api`](https://github.com/MatthewZito/goldmund-automated-cluster/tree/master/packages/goldmund-api) - Persistent data processing service and REST API
 - [`goldmund-client`](https://github.com/MatthewZito/goldmund-automated-cluster/tree/master/packages/goldmund-client) - Next.js isomorphic server for generating hybrid SSG/SSR React App at runtime
 - [`goldmund-cli`](https://github.com/MatthewZito/goldmund-automated-cluster/tree/master/packages/goldmund-cli) - Command-line utility for managing sessions, `goldmund-api` database content, and CDN uploads/eager transformations
 - [`goldmund-server`](https://github.com/MatthewZito/goldmund-automated-cluster/tree/master/packages/goldmund-server) - A mock ingress and load balancer (dev only)

### <a name="features"> Features
  - Distributed micro-service atchitecture coordinated with Kubernetes and Helm
  - Local development streamlined with Skaffold
  - Fully automated testing, auditing, builds, and production deployments via a single webhook
  - Custom Nginx-Ingress Controller and Issuer daemon automates TLS certificate renewal and executes infra / CSR challenges
  - Hardened security profile including HTTPs, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Cluster-wide security policies, rotational logging, and sanitization / validation middleware
  - Custom [Lambda architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_architecture) database layer supported by a portable Redis caching layer
  - RESTful microservice and API for serving and normalizing data, batch processing (`goldmund-api`)
  - Hybrid statically generated (SSG) / server-side rendered (SSR) frontend (`goldmund-client`) utilizes code-splitting, lazy loading, and dynamic imports for performance optimization
  - Command-line utility for localized sessions, database, and CDN management  (`goldmund-cli`) 
  - Custom middlewares. There are some esoteric and interesting HTTP Headers here - see if you can find them!

Local development is greatly aided by Skaffold. In order to run local dev instance:
1. Register ledger secret object 
2. `skaffold dev`

To deploy:
Merge into branch Master with deployment trigger *i.e. the commit message keyword*

### <a name="todo"></a> Todos + Upcoming Features

 - Add analytics dashboard + campaigns (tracking per post analytics in a separate DB collection)
 - Enable Progressive Web App (PWA) support (As an aside, see: [why I will NOT be using AMP](https://medium.com/@danbuben/why-amp-is-bad-for-your-site-and-for-the-web-e4d060a4ff31))
 
#### <a name="random"> Note to visitors

If you are a hiring manager, recruiter, or otherwise an interested party considering my competencies as they might apply to your needs, please consider this project to be an exemplar of what I can design and build unassisted. My hope here is that this delimits *my* capabilities from those pertinent to apps on which I have worked in a collaborative capacity (just about everything in any developer's professional portfolio). That is, here, you can see that I indeed can effectively employ tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, et al. 

If you'd like to work together, you are invited to email me [here](https://goldmund.sh/communications).

#### What's up with the name?
Oh, 'Goldmund'? I'm a very big Hesse fan. You should read *Narzi√ü und Goldmund* if you haven't already.
